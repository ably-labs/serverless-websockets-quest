# Ably Community Code of Conduct

We, at Ably, value every member’s participation in our community and want to make everyone feel welcome. We have this Code of Conduct to outline what is expected from our community members and expect all members to respect and follow it.

This Code of Conduct has the following parts: Our Pledge, Our Standards, Enforcement and Attributions.

## Our Pledge

We as community leaders, members, contributors, event attendees, speakers, sponsors and partners pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or email address or other identifying information, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting, this isn’t an exhaustive list

 
## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, messages, commits, questions and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of community spaces include physical and virtual events that we organise or participate in irrespective of platform or venue, in online social spaces for example Discord and in broadcasting platforms such as Twitch.

## Enforcement Guidelines

If you witness or are subject to instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour, it should be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [devrel@ably.com](mailto:devrel@ably.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, with communication being provided on progress and outcome. If a report is being made about a team member of Ably DevRel, the reporter can instead email [jo.franchetti@ably.com](mailto:Jo.franchetti@ably.com) or [beth.loft@ably.com](mailto:beth.loft@ably.com).
